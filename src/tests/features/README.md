# 🧪 Feature Test Strategy for Echo AI Companion Game

## 📋 Test Architecture Overview

This directory contains comprehensive feature tests designed to validate core game functionality before implementing new features. Tests are organized by feature domains and follow behavior-driven development (BDD) principles.

## 🎯 Test Coverage Goals

### Core Features (Must Have - 95% Coverage)
- ✅ **Game State Management**: Initialization, persistence, state updates
- ✅ **AI Conversation System**: Message flow, context building, response handling
- ✅ **Companion State**: Emotion updates, relationship progression, memory management
- ✅ **Provider System**: Claude API integration, fallback to Mock, error handling

### Integration Features (Should Have - 85% Coverage) 
- 🔄 **Real-time Chat Flow**: Complete user message → AI response cycle
- 🔄 **State Persistence**: Save/load game state across sessions
- 🔄 **Performance Optimization**: Caching, token management, response times
- 🔄 **Error Recovery**: Graceful degradation, user feedback

### User Experience Features (Nice to Have - 70% Coverage)
- ⏳ **First-time User Journey**: Onboarding, tutorial, first conversation
- ⏳ **Relationship Building**: Experience progression, milestone unlocking
- ⏳ **Advanced Interactions**: Personality adaptation, mood recognition

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

### Given-When-Then Structure
All feature tests follow BDD patterns:
```typescript
// Given: Set up initial state and conditions
// When: Perform the action being tested  
// Then: Verify expected outcomes and side effects
```

### Test Pyramid Approach
- **Unit Tests (60%)**: Individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests (30%)**: Feature interactions and API calls
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: Complete user workflows

### Realistic Test Data
- Use actual Korean conversation examples
- Simulate real user behavior patterns
- Test with production-like data volumes

## 📊 Quality Gates

### Performance Requirements
- **AI Response Time**: <2000ms (Claude API), <100ms (Mock), <50ms (Cache)
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB during normal operation
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >30% in typical usage scenarios
- **Error Rate**: <5% under normal conditions

### Reliability Requirements  
- **API Fallback**: 100% fallback success rate when Claude API unavailable
- **State Recovery**: 100% state recovery after application restart
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 50+ concurrent conversations without degradation

### User Experience Requirements
- **Conversation Quality**: >80% appropriate emotional responses
- **Context Awareness**: >90% context retention across conversation turns
- **Korean Language**: 100% Korean character support and proper encoding

## 🔧 Test Utilities and Helpers

### Test Fixtures
```typescript
export const createTestCompanion = (): AICompanion => ({ ... })
export const createTestGameState = (): GameState => ({ ... })
export const mockAIResponse = (emotion: EmotionType): AIResponse => ({ ... })
```

### Custom Matchers
```typescript
expect(response).toBeKoreanText()
expect(conversation).toMaintainContext()
expect(emotion).toBeAppropriateFor(input)
```

### Mock Providers
```typescript
export const MockClaudeProvider = { ... }
export const MockGameStore = { ... }
export const MockAIManager = { ... }
```

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Individual Feature Areas
```bash
# Core game functionality
npm run test:features:core

# AI system functionality  
npm run test:features:ai

# User journey scenarios
npm run test:features:journey

# Performance and reliability
npm run test:features:performance

# Edge cases and error handling
npm run test:features:edge-cases
```

### Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
# All feature tests
npm run test:features

# Feature tests with coverage
npm run test:features:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:features:watch
```

# Full validation for CI/CD
npm run test:features:ci
```

## 📈 Test Reporting

### Coverage Reports
- **HTML Report**: `coverage/features/index.html`
- **Console Output**: Summary with pass/fail counts
- **CI Integration**: JUnit XML for pipeline integration

### Performance Metrics
- Response time percentiles (50th, 95th, 99th)
- Memory usage patterns and peak consumption
- Cache hit rates and effectiveness metrics

### Quality Metrics  
- Conversation quality scoring
- Context retention accuracy
- Error recovery success rates

## 🔍 Debug and Troubleshooting

### Test Environment Setup
```typescript
// Enable detailed logging for failing tests
process.env.TEST_DEBUG = 'true'

// Use real API for integration testing
process.env.USE_REAL_API = 'true'  

// Disable caching for deterministic tests
process.env.DISABLE_CACHE = 'true'
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Flaky AI Response Tests**
   - Use deterministic mock responses for consistency
   - Set fixed random seeds for reproducible results
   - Implement retry logic for network-dependent tests

2. **State Management Issues**  
   - Clear store state between tests
   - Use isolated test environments
   - Verify state mutations are properly isolated

3. **Performance Test Variability**
   - Run performance tests multiple times
   - Use statistical analysis for consistent results  
   - Account for system load variations

## 📝 Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Feature Tests
1. Create test file in appropriate feature directory
2. Follow Given-When-Then structure
3. Include both happy path and edge cases
4. Add performance and reliability checks
5. Update this README with new coverage areas

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Maintain backward compatibility
2. Update test data to reflect current game state
3. Review and adjust performance thresholds
4. Ensure tests remain deterministic and reliable

### Test Review Process
1. All feature tests must pass before feature implementation
2. New features require corresponding test updates
3. Performance regressions trigger automatic alerts
4. Monthly test suite maintenance and optimization
