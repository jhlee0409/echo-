/**
 * ðŸ”Œ State Adapters - Clean Interface Layer for State Management
 *
 * Provides domain-specific adapters that abstract the underlying
 * store implementation details and provide a clean API for components
 *
 * Benefits:
 * - Decouples UI from store implementation
 * - Enables easy store migration/refactoring
 * - Provides type-safe domain-specific APIs
 * - Centralizes state logic and transformations
